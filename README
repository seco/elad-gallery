elad-gallery is an image gallery, that was designed with the following principles in mind:
* Keep it simple.
* High performance using browser and server level cache, make it as fast as possible. 
* Easy to use UI
* Use as much HTML5 and CSS3 as possible
* basic support for older browsers

Known bugs:
* the extract-strings.sh script is a bit broken.
* Code duplication
* No documentation

Whislist (see also TODO in a separate file):
* Image uploader
* User defined metadata
* Allow password protection to some folders

Installation instructions:
* Put the files somewhere in your webserver
* Read the code
* Edit settings.php.example so it would match your setup and rename it to settings.php
* Make sure Apache has write permission for all sub-directories that has images, so caching will work
* Have fun!
You'll probably want to add these lines to your .htaccess:

AddType image/svg+xml svg
<FilesMatch "\.(js|css|svg|appcache|html|htm)$">
